#Block Drop

BlockDrop is a shameless Tetris&reg; clone using pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
I started writing it while teaching myself how to use JavaScript as a proper language and wean myself off jQuery.
I'm also using it as a testing platform for various JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 features.
I've tested in Chrome, Firefox, IE 9/10 and Chrome for Android so it should work on most modern platforms.

###Controls:
* &#x25C0; `a` `h` or swipe &larr; moves the piece left
* &#x25B6; `d` `l` or swipe &rarr; moves the piece right
* &#x25B2; `w` `k` swipe &uarr;, or single tap rotates the piece 90&deg; clock-wise
* &#x25BC; `s` `j` or swipe &darr; soft drops the piece (drop line by line)
* `spacebar` or `&crarr; enter` hard drops the piece (drop all the way to the bottom)
